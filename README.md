# Annual People Analytics Report
At the end of every year, **The Bloom Company** People Analytics Team publishes an Annual People Analytics Report to be distributed to relevant stakeholders & management. For the last two years (since the beginning of 2010 until the end of 2011), **The Bloom Company** has been focusing a lot on improving employee retention and hiring activity.

Some of our objectives were to increase employee retention rate & company growth rate, through initiatives such as allocating budget for new tenure-based reward programs, conducting a more thorough manpower planning based on historical data, as well as ensuring hiring inclusivity in regards to age & gender distributions among employees.

This year (2011), we would like to evaluate whether the efforts have been successful or not. As a People Analytics Associate, you need to make sure that this yearâ€™s Annual People Analytics Report provides all the insights needed to answer the questions regarding the success of our previously-launched initiatives.
